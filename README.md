# atlasw
Really simple wrapper for the atlas-* commands.

## Usage
Make sure the wrapper is executable ```chmod +x ./atlasw``` then execute the ```./atlasw``` command with a space before the command.

Ex:

	./atlasw run
	./atlasw clean

## TODO
Future versions could include:

- Global installation
- Automatic downloading / installing of the Atlassian SDK
- Targetting other directories with a flag instead of needing to execute within the project directory
